# Sorted Integer Checker
A simple program to check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order.

## Usage
  -  Input a list of integers separated by spaces (e.g. "1 3 3 7")
  -  The program will output "True" if the list is sorted in ascending order, and "False" otherwise

## Examples
  -  Input: 1 3 3 7
  -  Output: True

  -  Input: 3 1 4 1
  -  Output: False

## How it works
  -  The program reads the input string and splits it into a list of integers
  -  It then checks if the list is equal to its sorted version
  -  If they are equal, the list is sorted and the program outputs "True"
  - If they are not equal, the list is not sorted and the program outputs "False"
